//Little Sander found a lot of numbers lying around, so he decided to have some fun with them. Since he's a #1 fan of prime numbers, he decided to associate each number he found with a prime number. He's also extremely proficient in the binary numeral system, so it's no wonder his association technique has something to do with it.
//
//For each number num Sander found, he calculates the number of '1's in its binary representation. Let this number be o . The prime number associated with num is thus the oth prime number (0-based).
//
//Given num, your task is to find the prime number associated with it. You should probably keep in mind that Sander believes that 0 and 1 are also prime numbers, and we're not going to argue with him right now.
//
//Example
//
//For num = 15, the output should be
//onesPosition(num) = 5.
//
//1510 = 11112, so the answer is the fourth 0-based prime number (as Sanders sees them). Here are the first five Sanders-prime numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5. Thus, the output should be 5.
